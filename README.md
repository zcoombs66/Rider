# Rider


All my life I have wanted a motorcycle and here recently I was finally able to get one. However Georgia weather has not been kind to me since, so I haven't been able to ride it much. Ever since I got it every few hours I'm checking the weather to see how things are looking. This is where I came up with the idea for Fair Weather Rider. 

My ultimate goal is to turn it into an app or widget on my phone so it is easily used, but I don't have the knowledge or time to do that in a weekend so I decided to come up with a prototype website. My goal is that after the Hackathon is over to go back refine a few thing and keep pushing forward on making it an actual app. 

I went with react for this project because it is really the only framework I have experience in. 

Although this version is very much a work in progress, I do plan on making it worthwhile with more features, a database, and better styling. 

I would appreciate any and all advice, my email is zcoombs66@gmail.com.
